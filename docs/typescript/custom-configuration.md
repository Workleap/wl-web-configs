# Custom configuration

If you are in the process of **migrating an existing project** to use this library or encountering a challenging situation that is not currently handled by this library, you might want to customize the default shared configurations.

!!!
For a list of the rules included with the default shared configurations, refer to the configuration files in the following [folder](https://github.com/gsoft-inc/wl-web-configs/tree/main/packages/typescript-configs) on Github.
!!!

## Disable a default rule



## Change a default rule value

## Start from scratch

If your situation is so challenging that you must start a new configuration from scratch, refer to the [advanced composition](advanced-composition.md) page.
