# SWC

!!!warning
`@workleap/swc-configs` is now in maintenance mode, with the exception of the [Jest shared configurations](./configure-jest.md), which remain actively maintained. If you're starting a new project, consider using [@workleap/rsbuild-configs](../rsbuild/default.md) or [@workleap/rslib-configs](../rslib/default.md) instead for better performance and modern tooling.
!!!

<!-- !!!warning Before you continue...

The preferred way for using `@workleap/swc-configs` is **not** by installing the library manually, but rather by **scaffolding** your application with Workleap's [foundry-cli](https://github.com/gsoft-inc/wl-foundry-cli).

+++ pnpm
```bash
pnpm create @workleap/project@latest <output-directory>
```
+++ yarn
```bash
yarn create @workleap/project@latest <output-directory>
```
+++ npm
```bash
npm create @workleap/project@latest <output-directory>
```
