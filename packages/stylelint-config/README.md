[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@workleap/stylelint-config)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@workleap/stylelint-config)

## Installation

Install the package.

**With pnpm**
```shell
pnpm add -D @workleap/stylelint-config
```

## Usage

Create a `.stylelintrc.json` file at the root of your project with the following content:
```json
{
    "$schema": "https://json.schemastore.org/stylelintrc",
    "extends": "@workleap/stylelint-config"
}
```

## Prettier

Since Stylelint v15.0.0, stylistic rules are deprecated. They now suggest using Prettier to format your CSS files.

With that in mind, the `@workleap/stylelint-config` includes the [stylelint-prettier plugin](https://github.com/prettier/stylelint-prettier). Using this plugin, prettier changes are exposed as stylelint rule violations.

You should therefore add either a `.editorconfig` or `.prettierrc` file at the root of your project. These rule will be run against your CSS files and will be autofixed when you run stylelint --fix **/*.css.

You need to make sure that you create a `.prettierignore` file to ignore everything but your CSS files at the root of your project. This file should contain the following content:

```
*
!**/*.css
```

Otherwise, Prettier will format your JS/TS/JSON and other type of files and you will end up with a conflict between Prettier and ESLint.
